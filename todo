    -Need to fix UI for login and logout pages. auto form validation is built for a single column flex box, specifically the failed form validation error responses take up a cell to themselves.
    -try linking users to words and see if many to many relationship between users and words will let each individual have a seperate sorted access for their own categories and protection from modifying another users words and protection from deleting words from the main table with links to other users words.
